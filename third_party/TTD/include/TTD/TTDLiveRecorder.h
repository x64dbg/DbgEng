// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
//
// Note: this API is currently in preview, and is subject to change.
//
// This file describes the interface exposed by TTD's Recording Engine, accessible via TTDLiveRecorder.dll.
//
// Definitions:
//
// "client" or "recording client" is the code that uses this API to interact with the recorder.
// "client GUID" is a GUID value belonging to the client. This value can be used to later identify
//      the various pieces of data that the client puts in the recording.
// "island" is a single stretch of recording in a single thread, from when the recording was started
//      to when it was stopped.
// "activity" is a group of islands, possibly on multiple threads, that the client marks with a common ID,
//      for some purpose known to the client.
// "custom event" is a point of interest in the recording marked by the client, with some data associated with it.
// "throttle" is a voluntary end of the current island of recording, based on some condition indicated by the client.
// "user data" is a raw array of bytes that the client may provide at various points during the recording,
//      for instance when opening the interface, starting islands or recording custom events.
//      This data will be included in the recording and it is up to the client to later correctly interpret it.
//
//
// This interface is retrieved by calling the MakeLiveRecorder() function.
// This function receives a client GUID which is used to identify the component wanting to interact with the recording.
// It is a GUID so that multiple clients can generate their own without need to coordinate with each other.
// Any data that is defined and provided by the client, including payload blobs and activity IDs,
// will have the client GUID attached to it in the file.
// The replay engine exposes all the client-defined data together with the GUID,
// so any client code using the replay engine can filter out the data that pertains to clients other than itself.
//
// The client is expected to invoke Start/StopRecordingCurrentThread() to generate islands of recorded code
// on the calling thread. Every island has a client-defined activity ID (a 32-bit token),
// so that islands belonging to the same activity may be bound together more tightly during replay.
// Every island can also have a user data blob with additional data about the reason to record the island.
//
// The client may invoke TryPause/ResumeRecording() to skip portions of code from being recorded on the calling thread.
// Note that ResumeRecording() should only be invoked if TryPauseRecording() returned true,
// which indicates that the thread was being recorded in the first place.
// This can be easily done and enforced by using the provided ScopedPauseRecording class,
// instead of calling the functions directly.
//
// The client may invoke AddCustomEvent() to add an annotation to the trace file,
// bound to the current position in the timeline.
// This custom event may be global, or assigned to the current thread.
// It may also optionally be used to generate a keyframe, which is useful if the event will be used as part of a
// memory query scheme on replay, because all memory queries coming from the index get a keyframe sequence ID.
//
// The client may use GetState() to query information about the recording performed on the calling thread.
//
// The client may call any of the DumpXXX() functions from any thread at any time to include
// snapshots of various pieces of memory in the recording.
//
// It's worth noting a subtlety in nomenclature here.
// It is said that a thread is being "recorded" when its code is being emulated and fed to the trace file.
// This is subtly different from being "in an island" or "in a Start/Stop sequence".
// When StartRecordingCurrentThread() is called, recording commences, but then it can be paused or halted arbitrarily.
// In that case, the thread is not being recorded, but it is still recording the same island when recording resumes.
//
// TTD's recording behavior is to either record everything by default or nothing by default.
// - When it's recording everything by default, all its threads will be
//   initially recording islands that are not associated with the recording client.
//   In that case, the client may use this API to monitor recorder state, pause and resume.
//   A client can also call StartRecordingCurrentThread() if they so desire (optionally calling Stop first),
//   which will terminate the current island and start a new one associated with the client.
// - When it's recording nothing by default, the only islands that will be recorded are those
//   explicitly started by the client via StartRecordingCurrentThread().
//
// It is an unlikely scenario that a process will have more than one recording client.
// The most likely way for this to happen would be an app which is attempting to control its own recording,
// but also coexisting with some client injected by a framework, like a CLR-aware recording client.
// If that ever happens, it's up to the clients to "be reasonably mindful and nice to each other".
// Pause/Resume is safe to call in all scenarios, no matter who may have started recording a thread.
// Before calling StartRecordingCurrentThread(), a client should call GetState(),
// to ensure the current thread is not being recorded on behalf of another client.
